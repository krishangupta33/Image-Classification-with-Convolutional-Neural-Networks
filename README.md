# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

## Objective
The aim of this project is to help you gain practical experience with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically in the context of image classification. You'll implement a CNN using a deep learning framework (like PyTorch or TensorFlow), and get familiar with key concepts such as convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers.

## Dataset
CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100. These datasets are widely used in the machine learning community and will allow you to compare your model's performance with reported benchmarks

## Steps

1. **Loading and preprocessing the dataset**: 

2. **Implementing a CNN**: 

3. **Training CNN**: 
4. **Evaluating model**:
